This is a fork of VLLM
- The goal was to create a version that wouldn't crash on fips enabled boxes due to the opencv-python-headless cv2 problem.
- This has not been fully tested, currently a new branch was created called opencve_python_headless_fix
- opencv-python-headless (cv2) is now completely absent from the image and PyAV (av) is handling all video operations.

---
## Instructions:
- mkdir vllm_fips
- git clone ..
- cd vllm_fips
- DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . \
    --file docker/Dockerfile \
    --target vllm-openai \
    --build-arg VLLM_USE_PRECOMPILED=1 \
    --build-arg VLLM_MERGE_BASE_COMMIT="2e6888ee879a29d511c81bd45f8265d92d0bafd9a5e52a6ceec6c0e25801475f" \
    --tag vllm-fips:v0.2

## To test if cv2 is removed:
docker run --rm --entrypoint python3 vllm-fips:v0.2 -c "
import av, vllm
try:
    import cv2
    raise SystemExit('ERROR: cv2 is still installed!')
except ImportError:
    print('SUCCESS: cv2 is not installed; PyAV version:', av.__version__)
"

## Running Container {example}
- docker run --rm --gpus all \
    -v ~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface \
    -p 8000:8000 \
    --ipc=host \
    --env "HF_TOKEN=${HF_TOKEN}" \
    vllm-fips:v0.2 

## About (Forked Repo Info)

vLLM is a fast and easy-to-use library for LLM inference and serving.

Originally developed in the [Sky Computing Lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley, vLLM has grown into one of the most active open-source AI projects built and maintained by a diverse community of many dozens of academic institutions and companies from over 2000 contributors.

vLLM is fast with:

- State-of-the-art serving throughput
- Efficient management of attention key and value memory with [**PagedAttention**](https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html)
- Continuous batching of incoming requests, chunked prefill, prefix caching
- Fast and flexible model execution with piecewise and full CUDA/HIP graphs
- Quantization: FP8, MXFP8/MXFP4, NVFP4, INT8, INT4, GPTQ/AWQ, GGUF, compressed-tensors, ModelOpt, TorchAO, and [more](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/features/quantization/index.html)
- Optimized attention kernels including FlashAttention, FlashInfer, TRTLLM-GEN, FlashMLA, and Triton
- Optimized GEMM/MoE kernels for various precisions using CUTLASS, TRTLLM-GEN, CuTeDSL
- Speculative decoding including n-gram, suffix, EAGLE, DFlash
- Automatic kernel generation and graph-level transformations using torch.compile
- Disaggregated prefill, decode, and encode

vLLM is flexible and easy to use with:

- Seamless integration with popular Hugging Face models
- High-throughput serving with various decoding algorithms, including *parallel sampling*, *beam search*, and more
- Tensor, pipeline, data, expert, and context parallelism for distributed inference
- Streaming outputs
- Generation of structured outputs using xgrammar or guidance
- Tool calling and reasoning parsers
- OpenAI-compatible API server, plus Anthropic Messages API and gRPC support
- Efficient multi-LoRA support for dense and MoE layers
- Support for NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs, Intel GPUs, and x86/ARM/PowerPC CPUs. Additionally, diverse hardware plugins such as Google TPUs, Intel Gaudi, IBM Spyre, Huawei Ascend, Rebellions NPU, Apple Silicon, MetaX GPU, Iluvatar CoreX GPU, and more.

vLLM seamlessly supports 200+ model architectures on Hugging Face, including:

- Decoder-only LLMs (e.g., Llama, Qwen, Gemma)
- Mixture-of-Expert LLMs (e.g., Mixtral, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen-MoE, GPT-OSS)
- Hybrid attention and state-space models (e.g., Mamba, Qwen3.5)
- Multi-modal models (e.g., LLaVA, Qwen-VL, Pixtral)
- Embedding and retrieval models (e.g., E5-Mistral, GTE, ColBERT)
- Reward and classification models (e.g., Qwen-Math)
